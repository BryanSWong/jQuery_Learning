Binding events to elements that don't exist yet<br><br>

This is called event delegation. Here's an example just for completeness,<br><br>

$("ul").on("click", "li", function(){<br>
console.log("Something in a < ul> was clicked, and we detected that it was an < li> element");<br>
});<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>list 1</li>
    <li>list 2</li>
    <li>list 3</li>
    <li>list 4</li>
</ul>


<script>
    $("ul").on("click", "li", function(){
        console.log("Something in a <ul> was clicked, and we detected that it was an <li> element");
    });
</script>
