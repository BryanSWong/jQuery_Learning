<h4>Ways to listen for events</h4>

<p>
There are many ways to listen for events. Actions are constantly
occurring on a webpage, but the developer is only notified about
them if they're listening for them. Listening for an event basically
means you're waiting for the browser to tell you that a specific
event has occurred and then you'll specify how the page should react.
</p>


<p>
To specify to the browser what to do when an event occurs, you provide
a function, also known as an event handler. This function is executed
whenever the event occurs (or until the event is unbound).
</p>


For instance, to alert a message whenever a user clicks on a button,<br>
you might write something like this:<br>
<br>

< button onclick="alert('Hello')">Say hello< / button><br><br>



<button onclick="alert('Hello')"> Say hello </button>
