<h4>How can I mimic a native browser event, if not .trigger()?</h4>

<p>
In order to trigger a native browser event, you have to use
    document.createEventObject for < IE9 and document.createEvent
    for all other browsers. Using these two APIs, you can programmatically
    create an event that behaves exactly as if someone has actually clicked
    on a file input box. The default action will happen, and the browse
    file dialog will display.
</p>
<p>
The jQuery UI Team created jquery.simulate.js in order to
    simplify triggering a native browser event for use in
    their automated testing. Its usage is modeled after jQuery's trigger.
</p>

Example:<br><br>

<a href="http://learn.jquery.com">Learn JQuery</a> A Link

$("a").simulate("click");<br><br>

This will not only trigger the jQuery event handlers, but also <br>
follow the link and change the current page.<br>

<script>
    $("a").simulate("click");
</script>


<h4>.trigger() vs .triggerHandler()</h4>
There are four differences between .trigger() and .triggerHandler()<br><br>

(1).triggerHandler() only triggers the event on the first element of a jQuery object.
<br><br>

(2).triggerHandler() cannot be chained. It returns the value that is <br>
returned by the last handler, not a jQuery object.<br><br>
(3).triggerHandler() will not cause the default behavior of the event (such as a form submission).
<br><br>
(4)Events triggered by .triggerHandler(), will not bubble up the DOM hierarchy.<br>
Only the handlers on the single element will fire.<br>
