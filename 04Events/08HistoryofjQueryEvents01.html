<h4>History of jQuery Events</h4>
<p>
Throughout the evolution of jQuery the means of event binding has
    changed for various reasons ranging from performance to semantics.
    As of jQuery v1.7 the .on() method is the accepted means of both
    directly binding events and creating delegated events. This article
    aims to explore the history of event delegation from jQuery v1.0
    to the present and how each version leverages it.

<p>
Given the following HTML, for our example we want to log the text of
    the each < li> to console whenever it is clicked.
</p>

<div id="container">
    <ul id="list">
        <li>Item #1</li>
        <li>Item #2</li>
        <li>Item #3</li>
        <li>...</li>
        <li>Item #100</li>
    </ul>
</div>


<h3>.bind() (Deprecated)</h3>

It is possible to use .bind() and attach a handler to every element.

Example:<br><br>

$("#list li").bind("click" , function(event){<br>
var elem = $(event.target);<br>
console.log(elem.text());<br>
});<br>

<script>
    $("#list li").bind("click", function(event){
        var elem = $(event.target);
        console.log(elem.text());
    });
</script>

even though deprecated this example still works.
