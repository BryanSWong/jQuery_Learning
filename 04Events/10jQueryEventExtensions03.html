<h4>The handleObj object</h4>
<p>
Many of the special event hook functions below are passed a handleObj
    object that provides more information about the event, how it was
    attached, and its current state. This object and its contents should
    be treated as read-only data, and only the properties below are documented
    for use by special event handlers. For the discussion below, assume an
    event is attached with this code:
</p>

$( ".dialog" ).on( "click.myPlugin", "button", {<br>
mydata: 42<br>
}, myHandler );<br>
<br>
<script>
    $( ".dialog" ).on( "click.myPlugin", "button", {
        mydata: 42
    }, myHandler );
</script>
