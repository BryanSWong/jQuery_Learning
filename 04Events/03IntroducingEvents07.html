<p>
    When utilizing both .preventDefault() and .stopPropagation()
    simultaneously, you can instead return false to achieve both
    in a more concise manner, but it's advisable to only return
    false when both are actually necessary and not just for the
    sake of terseness. A final note on .stopPropagation() is that
    when using it in delegated events, the soonest that event
    bubbling can be stopped is when the event reaches the element
    that is delegating it.
</p>

<p>
    It's also important to note that the event object contains
    a property called originalEvent, which is the event object
    that the browser itself created. jQuery wraps this native
    event object with some useful methods and properties, but
    in some instances, you'll need to access the original
    event via event.originalEvent for instance. This is
    especially useful for touch events on mobile devices
    and tablets.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, to inspect the event itself and see all of the
    data it contains, you should log the event in the browser's
    console using console.log. This will allow you to see all of
    an event's properties (including the originalEvent) which
    can be really helpful for debugging.

Logging an event's information<br><br>

$("form").on("submit", function(event){<br>
// Prevent the form's default submission.<br>
event.preventDefault();<br>
// Log the event object for inspecting<br>
console.log(event);<br>
});
<br><br>

<form>
    First Name:<input type="text" name="fName"><br>
    Last Name:<input type="text" name="lName"><br>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<script>
    $("form").on("submit", function(event){
        event.preventDefault();
        console.log("event");
    });
