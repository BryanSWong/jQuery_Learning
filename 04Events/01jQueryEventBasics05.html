<h5>Inside the Event Handler Function</h5>

<p>
    Every event handling function receives an event object, which contains many properties
    and methods. The event object is most commonly used to prevent the default action of
    the event via the .preventDefault() method. However, the event object contains a
    number of other useful properties and methods, including as well:
</p>

target<br><br>

The DOM element that initiated the event.<br><br>

namespace<br><br>

The namespace specified when the event was triggered.<br><br>

timeStamp<br><br>

The difference in milliseconds between the time the event occurred in the browser and January 1, 1970.<br><br>

preventDefault()<br><br>

Prevent the default action of the event (e.g. following a link).<br><br>

stopPropagation()<br><br>

Stop the event from bubbling up to other elements.<br><br>

In addition to the event object, the event handling function also has access <br>
to the DOM element that the handler was bound to via the keyword this. To turn <br>
the DOM element into a jQuery object that we can use jQuery methods on, we <br>
simply do $( this ), often following this idiom:<br><br>

var element = $( this );<br><br>

A fuller example would be:<br><br>

Preventing a link from being followed<br>
$("a").click(function(eventObject){<br>
var elem = $(this);<br>
if(elem.attr("href").match(/evil/)){<br>
eventObject.preventDefualt();<br>
elem.addClass("evil");<br>
});<br><br>

<a href="http://www.evil.com/" >evil link</a>

<script>
    $("a").click(function(eventObject){
        var elem = $(this);
        if(elem.attr("href").match(/evil/)){
            eventObject.preventDefault();
            elem.addClass("evil");
        }
    });

</script>
