<p>
    If the element has default functionality for a specific event
    (like a link opens a new page, a button in a form submits the
    form, etc.), that default functionality can be cancelled.
    This is often useful for AJAX requests. When a user clicks
    on a button to submit a form via AJAX, we'd want to cancel
    the button/form's default action (to submit it to the form's
    action attribute), and we would instead do an AJAX request to
    accomplish the same task for a more seamless experience. To do
    this, we would utilize the event object and call its .preventDefault()
    method. We can also prevent the event from bubbling up the DOM tree
    using .stopPropagation() so that parent elements aren't notified
    of its occurrence (in the case that event delegation is being used).

Preventing a default action from occurring and stopping the event bubbling<br><br>

$("form").on("submit", function(event){<br>
// Prevent the form's default submission.<br>
event.preventDefault();<br>
// Prevent event from bubbling up DOM tree, prohibiting delegation<br>
event.stopPropation();<br>
// Make an AJAX request to submit the form data<br>
});<br><br>

<form>
    First Name:<input type="text" name="fName"><br>
    Last Name:<input type="text" name="lName"><br>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<script>
    $("form").on("submit", function(event){
        event.preventDefault();
        event.stopPropagation();
        alert("action check");
        console.log("action check");
    });
