var helloBtn = document.getElementById("helloBtn");<br><br>

helloBtn.addEventListener("click", function(event){<br>
alert("Hello.");<br>
}, false);<br><br>

<p>
    Here we're saving a reference to the button element by
    calling getElementById and assigning its return value
    to a variable. We then call addEventListener and provide
    an event handler function that will be called whenever
    that event occurs. While there's nothing wrong with this
    code as it will work fine in modern browsers, it won't
    fare well in versions of IE prior to IE9. This is because
    Microsoft chose to implement a different method,
    attachEvent, as opposed to the W3C standard addEventListener,
    and didn't get around to changing it until IE9 was released.
    For this reason, it's beneficial to utilize jQuery because
    it abstracts away browser inconsistencies, allowing developers
    to use a single API for these types of tasks, as seen below.

Event binding using a convenience method<br>

$("#helloBtn").click(function(event){<br>
alert("Hello");<br>
});<br><br>

<button id="helloBtn">Say hello</button><br><br>


<script>
    $("#helloBtn").click(function(event){
       alert("Hello");
    });
</script>
