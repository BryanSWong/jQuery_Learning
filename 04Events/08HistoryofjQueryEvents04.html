<h4>.live() w/ context (Deprecated)</h4>

<p>
Passing the context as a second optional argument to the $()
function has been supported since v1.0. However support for using
this context with the $.live() method was not added until v1.4.
</p>

If we were take our previous .live() example and provide it the <br>
default context, it would look like:<br>

$("#list li",document).live("click", function(event){<br>
var elem = $(this);<br>
console.log(elem.text());<br>
});<br><br>

Since we can override the context when using the .live() method, <br>
we can specify a context that is closer to the element in the DOM hierarchy<br>
<br>

$("li","#list").live("click", function(event){<br>
var elem = $(this);<br>
console.log(elem.text());<br>
});<br><br>

<script>
    $("li", "#list").live("click", function(event){
        var elem = $(this);
        console.log(elem.text());
    });
</script>

<p>In this instance when an < li> is clicked the event still
    bubbles all the way up the document tree as it did before.
    However, our event handler is now bound to the parent < ul>
    tag, so we do not have to wait for the event to bubble all
    the way up to the document root.
</p>

this example does not work as it really has been deprecated.
