<p>
    jQuery provides a method .on() to respond to any event on the
    selected elements. This is called an event binding. Although
    .on() isn't the only method provided for event binding, it is
    a best practice to use this for jQuery 1.7+.

Simple event binding<br><br>

When any < p > tag is clicked, we expect to see "< p > was clicked"<br>
$("p").on("click", function(){<br>
console.log("< p> was clicked");<br>
});<br>

<p>Example paragraph</p>

<script>
    $("p").on("click", function(){
        console.log("<p> was clicked");
    });
</script>
