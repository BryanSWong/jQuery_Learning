<h4>Don't use .trigger() simply to execute specific functions</h4>
<p>
While this method has its uses, it should not be used simply to call
    a function that was bound as a click handler. Instead, you should
    store the function you want to call in a variable, and pass the
    variable name when you do your binding. Then, you can call the
    function itself whenever you want, without the need for .trigger().
</p>

Example:<br><br>

Triggering an event handler the right way<br><br>

var foo = function(event){<br>
if(event){<br>
console.log(event);<br>
} else{<br>
console.log("this didn't come from an event!");<br>
}<br>
};<br>

$("p").on("click", foo);<br><br>

foo(); // instead of $("p").trigger("click")


<script>
    var foo = function(event){
        if(event){
            console.log(event);
        }

        else{
            console.log("This didn't come from an event!");
        }
    };

    $("p").on("click", foo);

    foo();
</script>
