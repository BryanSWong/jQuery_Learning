    <title>Introducing Custom Events</title>

<h4>Custom Events</h4>
<p>
We're all familiar with the basic events — click, mouseover, focus,
    blur, submit, etc. — that we can latch on to as a user interacts
    with the browser. Custom events open up a whole new world of
    event-driven programming. In this chapter, we'll use jQuery's
    custom events system to make a simple Twitter search application.
</p>

<p>
It can be difficult at first to understand why you'd want
    to use custom events, when the built-in events seem to
    suit your needs just fine. It turns out that custom
    events offer a whole new way of thinking about event-driven
    JavaScript. Instead of focusing on the element that triggers
    an action, custom events put the spotlight on the element
    being acted upon. This brings a bevy of benefits, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Behaviors of the target element can easily
        be triggered by different elements using the same code.</li>
   <li>
       Behaviors can be triggered across multiple, similar, target elements at once.
   </li>
    <li>
    Behaviors are more clearly associated with the target
    element in code, making code easier to read and maintain.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Why should you care? An example is probably the best way to
    explain. Suppose you have a lightbulb in a room in a house.
    The lightbulb is currently turned on, and it's controlled by
    two three-way switches and a clapper:
</p>
Example html:<br>
< div> class="room" id="kitchen><br>
< div class="lightbulb on">< /div><br>
< div class="switch">< /div><br>
< div class="switch">< /div><br>
< div class="clapper"> < /div><br>
< /div><br><br>

Example html in action:
<div class="room" id="kitchen">
    <div class="lightbulb on">lightbulb</div>
    <div class="switch">switch</div>
    <div class="switch">switch</div>
    <div class="clapper">clapper</div>
</div>
<br><br>
Triggering the clapper or either of the switches will change <br>
the state of the lightbulb. The switches and the clapper don't <br>
care what state the lightbulb is in; they just want to change the state.<br><br>

Example script:<br><br>

$(".switch, .clapper").click(function(){<br>
var light = $(this).parent().find(".lightbulb");<br>
if(light.hasClass("on")){<br>
light.removeClass("on").addClass("off");<br>
} else{<br>
light.removeClass("off").addClass("on");<br>
}<br>
});<br><br>

<script>
    $(".switch, .clapper").click(function(){
        var light = $(this).parent().find(".lightbulb");
        if(light.hasClass("on")){
            light.removeClass("on").addClass("off");
        } else{
            light.removeClass("off").addClass("on");
        }
    });
</script>
