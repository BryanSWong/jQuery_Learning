<h5>Inside the Event Handler Function</h5>

<p>
Every event handling function receives an event object, which contains many properties
and methods. The event object is most commonly used to prevent the default action of
the event via the .preventDefault() method. However, the event object contains a
number of other useful properties and methods, including:
</p>

link pageX, pageY<br><br>

The mouse position at the time the event occurred, <br>
relative to the top left corner of the page display area (not the entire browser window).<br><br>

link type<br><br>

The type of the event (e.g. "click").<br><br>

link which The button or key that was pressed.<br><br>

link data<br><br>

Any data that was passed in when the event was bound. For example:<br><br>

Event setup using the '.on()' method with data<br><br>

$("input").on(
"change",<br>
{foo: "bar"}, // associate data with event binding<br>
function(eventObject){<br>
console.log("An input value was changed! " , eventObject.data.foo);<br>
}<br>
);<br><br>

<form>
    Input:<input type="text" name="input" value="">
</form>

<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script>

    $("input").on("change",
    {foo: "bar"},
    function(eventObject){
        console.log("An input value was changed! ", eventObject.data.foo);
    }
    );
