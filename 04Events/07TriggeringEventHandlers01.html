<h4>What handlers can be .trigger()'d?</h4>

<p>
jQuery's event handling system is a layer on top of native browser events.
    When an event handler is added using .on( "click", function() {...} ),
    it can be triggered using jQuery's .trigger( "click" ) because jQuery
    stores a reference to that handler when it is originally added.
    Additionally, it will trigger the JavaScript inside the onclick
    attribute. The .trigger() function cannot be used to mimic native
    browser events, such as clicking on a file input box or an anchor
    tag. This is because, there is no event handler attached using
    jQuery's event system that corresponds to these events.

Example:<br><br>

<a href="http://learn.jquery.com">Learn JQuery</a> A Link

<br><br>
Script:<br><br>
this will not change the current page<br>
$("a").trigger("click");<br><br>

this link still works as its a proper link.


<script>
    $("a").trigger("click");
</script>

</body>
</html>
