<h4>jQuery.event.fixHooks: Object</h4>

<p>
The fixHooks interface provides a per-event-type way to extend or
    normalize the event object that jQuery creates when it processes a
    native browser event. A fixHooks entry is an object that has two
    properties, each being optional:
</p>

<p>
props: Array: Strings representing properties that should be copied
    from the browser's event object to the jQuery event object. If omitted,
    no additional properties are copied beyond the standard ones that jQuery
    copies and normalizes (e.g. event.target and event.relatedTarget).
</p>

<p>
filter: Function( event, originalEvent ): jQuery calls this function after
    it constructs the jQuery.Event object, copies standard properties from
    jQuery.event.props, and copies the fixHooks-specific props (if any) specified
    above. The function can create new properties on the event object or modify
    existing ones. The second argument is the browser's native event object, which
    is also available in event.originalEvent.
</p>

<p>
Note that for all events, the browser's native event object is available in
    event.originalEvent; if the jQuery event handler examines the properties there
    instead of jQuery's normalized event object, there is no need to create a
    fixHooks entry to copy or modify the properties.
</p>
<p>
For example, to set a hook for the "drop" event that copies the dataTransfer
    property, assign an object to jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop:
</p>

Example script:<br><br>

jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop = {<br>
props: [ "dataTransfer" ]<br>
};<br><br>

<script>
    jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop = {
        props: [ "dataTransfer" ]
    };
</script>

<p>
Since fixHooks is an advanced feature and rarely used externally,
    jQuery does not include code or interfaces to deal with conflict
    resolution. If there is a chance that some other code may be assigning
    fixHooks to the same events, the code should check for an existing hook
    and take appropriate measures. A simple solution might look like this:
</p>


if ( jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop ) {<br>
throw new Error( "Someone else took the jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop hook!" );<br>
}<br><br>

jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop = {<br>
props: [ "dataTransfer" ]<br>
};<br><br>

<script>
    if ( jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop ) {
        throw new Error( "Someone else took the jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop hook!" );
    }

    jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop = {
        props: [ "dataTransfer" ]
    };
</script>

<p>
    When there are known cases of different plugins wanting to attach
    to the drop hook, this solution might be more appropriate:
</p>

var existingHook = jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop;<br><br>

if ( !existingHook ) {<br>
jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop = {<br>
props: [ "dataTransfer" ]<br>
};<br>
} else {<br>
if ( existingHook.props ) {<br>
existingHook.props.push( "dataTransfer" );<br>
} else {<br>
existingHook.props = [ "dataTransfer" ];<br>
}<br>
}<br><br>


<script>

    var existingHook = jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop;

    if ( !existingHook ) {
        jQuery.event.fixHooks.drop = {
            props: [ "dataTransfer" ]
        };
    } else {
        if ( existingHook.props ) {
            existingHook.props.push( "dataTransfer" );
        } else {
            existingHook.props = [ "dataTransfer" ];
        }
    }

</script>
