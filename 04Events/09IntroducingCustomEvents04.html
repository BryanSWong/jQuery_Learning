<h4>Recap: .on() and .trigger()</h4>

<p>
In the world of custom events, there are two important jQuery methods:
    .on() and .trigger(). In the Events chapter, we saw how to use
    these methods for working with user events; for this chapter,
    it's important to remember two things:
</p>

<ul>

    <li>
        .on() method takes an event type and an event handling
        function as arguments. Optionally, it can also receive
        event-related data as its second argument, pushing the
        event handling function to the third argument. Any data
        that is passed will be available to the event handling
        function in the data property of the event object. The
        event handling function always receives the event object
        as its first argument.
    </li>

    <li>
    .trigger() method takes an event type as its argument.
        Optionally, it can also take an array of values. These
        values will be passed to the event handling function as
        arguments after the event object.
    </li>
</ul>

Here is an example of the usage of .on() and .trigger() that uses custom data in both cases:
<br><br>

$(document).on("myCustomEvent", {<br>
foo: "bar"<br>
}, function(event, arg1, arg2){<br>
console.log(event.data.foo);<br>
console.log(arg1);<br>
console.log(arg2);<br>
});<br><br>

$(document).trigger("myCustomEvent", ["bim", "baz"]);<br><br>

<script>
    $(document).on("myCustomEvent", {
        foo: "bar"
    }, function(event, arg1, arg2){
       console.log(event.data.foo);
       console.log(arg1);
       console.log(arg2);
     });

    $(document).trigger("myCustomEvent", ["bim", "baz"]);


</script>

</body>
