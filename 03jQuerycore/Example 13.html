<h3>The .attr() method</h3>
<p>The .attr() method acts as both a getter and a setter.
    As a setter, .attr() can accept either a key and a value,
    or an object containing one or more key/value pairs.
</p>

.attr() as a setter:<br><br>

code:<br><br>

$("a").attr("href", "allMyHrefsAreTheSameNow.html");<br><br>

$("a").attr({<br>
title: "all titles are the same too!",<br>
href: "somethingNew.html"<br>
});<br>

the orginal a link below is:<br>
< a href="Example 01.html">< /a><br><br>

<a href="Example 01.html">This link has been changed.</a><br><br>


if you inspect the webpage you will see that the href has been changed.<br>
also a title was added, the reason why you don't see "allMyHrefsAreTheSameNow.html"<br>
is becuase the next $("a") call changed it to "somethingNew.html"<br>
but you can see all the action in console.
