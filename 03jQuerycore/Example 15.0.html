The most basic concept of jQuery is to "select some elements and do <br>
something with them." jQuery supports most CSS3 selectors, as well <br>
as some non-standard selectors.<br><br>

Examples:<br><br>

<p>This is a paragraph with out the id property but the paragraph with<br>
the id property is hidden below because it was selected and set to hide <br>
with jquery. you can inspect the webpage and see the paragraph.
</p>

Here is is the code:<br>
$("#myId).hide();<br>
<p id="myId"> This is a paragraph with the id property = myId.</p>
<br>

<p>This is a paragraph with out a class id. The other paragraph has the class<br>
id and is hidden due to jquery .hide() called on the selector of the class.<br>
you can inspect the webpage and see paragraph.
</p>
Here is is the code:<br>
$(".myClass").hide();
<p class="myClass">This paragraph has the class id = myClass.</p>

This form does not have the name attribute:<br>
<form><input value="This is a form input"></form>

The form below has the name attribute:<br>
<form><input name="first_name"></form><br>
it was hidden with the jquery .hide() you can inspect the webpage to see it.<br>
<br>

Here is is the code:<br>
$("input[name='first_name']").hide();<br><br>

Here is a un-ordered list with out the id = contents and  list item class = people.
<br>
There is also a paragraph in the ul tag<br>
<ul>
    <p>List 1:</p>
    <li>first item</li>
    <li>second item</li>
    <li>third item</li>

</ul>

with the compound selector option in jQuery you can select multiple elements<br>
in this case the ul tag had the class people and paragraph has the id contents<br>
and they are hidden with the .hide()<br><br>
Here is is the code:<br>
$("#contents, ul.people li").hide();

<ul class="people">
    <p id="contents">List 2:</p>
    <li >first item</li>
    <li>second item</li>
    <li>third item</li>
</ul>
<br><br><br>

Pseudo-Selectors<br><br>

$("a.external:first").hide();<br><br>
this selets the first link with the class external and does the jquery assigned,
<br>
in this case hide();<br>

<a class="external" href="Example 01">This is one link</a><br>
<a class="external" href="Example 02">This is another link</a><br><br>


$("tr:odd").hide();<br><br>
This selects all the odd elements of tr that have td data in a table<br>
and in this case applies the hide(); case remember that everything starts at "0"
<br>
0,1,2,3 [1,2,3,4] and the odds are hidden leaving 1 and 3<br>

<table border="solid">
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
</table><br><br>

$("#myForm:input).hide(); <br>
selects a input with id = myForm and hides it.<br><br>

<form>
    <input id="myForm">
</form><br><br>

$("div:visible).hide();<br><br>
all visible divs will be hidden with this code so I'm going to disable it
<br>
for the next few examples that will need divs visible to see what happens to them.
<br>
<br>
<div>This is a div</div>
<br><br>
$("div:gt(2)").hide(); // All except the first three divs.<br><br>
<div>This is a div 2</div><br>
<div id="div3">This is a div 3</div><br>
<div>This is a div 4</div><br>
<div>This is a div 5</div><br>
divs beyond the first three are hidden
<br><br>

$("div:animated").hide(): // All currently animated divs.<br><br>
Sadly you can see div 3 in animate action becuse its hidden already by above code.
<br>
